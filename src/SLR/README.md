# A Systematic Literature Review of Decompilation

## What is a SLR?

The systematic literature review originates from medical research and social science but has been adapted and extended to Software Engineering:

- ["SEGRESS: Software Engineering Guidelines for REporting Secondary Studies"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9772383)
- ["Guidelines for performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering"](https://legacyfileshare.elsevier.com/promis_misc/525444systematicreviewsguide.pdf)

To simplify:
- It is based on a defined search strategy that aims to detect as much of the relevant literature as possible.
- If some literature is excluded, it requires explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria to assess each potential primary study.
- Specify the information to be obtained from each primary 
study including quality criteria by which to evaluate each primary study.

**Other types of review**ï¼š

- Systematic Mapping Studies: plot the studies to find clusters and deserts to identify potential research areas or direct the focus of future systematic reviews.
- Tertiary Reviews: a systematic review of systematic reviews to answer wider research questions. (If a number of systematic reviews exist already).

### Filtering

If there are too many articles, you can filter them by:

- Study Type
  - include: Review and original content
  - exclude: Reports, thesis, and editorials
- Source: Peer-reviewed articles, Conference proceedings.
- Year of Publication: filter out something too old
- Language: only include English
- Techniques
